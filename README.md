# CODSOFT Data Science Internship

This repository contains all the 5 Project tasks that I have completed as part of the CODSOFT Data Science Internship.

## About the Internship

The CODSOFT Data Science Internship involves completing various data science projects to develop skills in data analysis, machine learning, and predictive modeling. Successful completion requires at least three projects, each demonstrating the application of different data science techniques.

## Projects

### Task 1: Titanic Survival Prediction

This project involves building a model to predict whether a passenger on the Titanic survived based on various features.

- **Objective:** Predict the survival of Titanic passengers.
- **Dataset:** [Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset)
- **Description:** The dataset includes features such as age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, and survival status.
- **Techniques Used:** Data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, logistic regression, and model evaluation.

### Task 2: Movie Rating Prediction with Python

In this project, I developed a model to predict movie ratings based on features like genre, director, and actors.

- **Objective:** Predict the rating of a movie.
- **Dataset:** [IMDB India Movies Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adrianmcmahon/imdb-india-movies)
- **Description:** The dataset contains historical movie data, including features relevant to rating predictions.
- **Techniques Used:** Data preprocessing, regression analysis, feature engineering, and model evaluation.

### Task 3: Iris Flower Classification

This project focuses on classifying Iris flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal measurements.

- **Objective:** Classify Iris flowers into three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.
- **Dataset:** [Iris Flower Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arshid/iris-flower-dataset)
- **Description:** The dataset provides measurements of Iris flowers categorized by species.
- **Techniques Used:** Data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, classification algorithms (e.g., k-nearest neighbors, decision trees), and model evaluation.

### Task 4: Sales Prediction Using Python

This project aims to predict future sales of products based on various factors such as advertising expenditure and target audience segmentation.

- **Objective:** Forecast product sales.
- **Dataset:** [Sales Prediction Dataset 1](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ashydv/sales-prediction-simple-linear-regression/input) | [Sales Prediction Dataset 2](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ashydv/sales-prediction-simple-linear-regression/input)
- **Description:** The dataset includes features relevant to sales prediction.
- **Techniques Used:** Data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, linear regression, and model evaluation.

### Task 5: Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project involves building a model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions.

- **Objective:** Identify fraudulent credit card transactions.
- **Dataset:** [Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
- **Description:** The dataset contains transaction data, including features indicating fraudulent or genuine transactions.
- **Techniques Used:** Data preprocessing, handling class imbalance, logistic regression, random forests, and model evaluation using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.
